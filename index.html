<!-- Week 7 Lab 01Nov21 Helene Suttle
Create a webpage that uses a form and asks the user for their 
name and email. 
When the user submits the form, the form should be hidden, and
 a message should appear in the following format:

[insert user name], thank you for your details. We will be in 
touch via [insert user email] shortly.
